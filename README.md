I work in the IT Security field, and to expand my skill set decided to start writing basic Golang. I'll be storing code here to document progress and goals.

I hope this repo will eventually store an array of tools that could be used in static host analysis.

Lets see what I can come up with...

Starting Game Plan:

1. Opening/Closing Files

2. Apply regular expressions to aformentioned file contents.

3. Semi - custom CLI tool


* This is not meant to replace known tools, just appease my curiosity *
